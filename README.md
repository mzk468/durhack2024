# Presidents Personal Assistant (PPA for short!)

Bringing back the three presidents meme at full force!

## What is the Presidents meme?

This is a meme from 2023, where three ex-presidents - Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, are seen to be constantly bickering and bantering over light hearted topics, turning a somewhat heated political environment in America into something to have a laugh over!

An example of this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qy4Ni3zwCHI)
